        This is an extension of the statistics project “Factors affecting final placements offers”. In 
this version of extension, data from different departments such as MBA, Pharmacy, MTech etc. 
were taken into consideration. As the aesthetics change with the change in departments, we 
gathered the raw data from all the sources such as google forms and the placement chronicles of 
the institute and performs ETL operations using the Power BI and visualizes it in a most insightful 
manner.<br><br>
Product Evolution: <br>
The Statistics project primarily focused on quantitative data to predict CTC based on various 
factors. However, for this project, our focus is on gathering significant insights related to the 
recruitment pattern from a macro perspective. Our emphasis is on industry perspectives and 
recruitment trends such as:<br>
1. What is the role offered, are they dependent on the branch specialization or technical
competencies of students or certifications.<br>
2. Which technical competencies are associated with higher packages?<br>
3. Which domains are recruiting the most people?<br>
4. What does the industry expect in return for higher packages?<br><br>
The expected outcomes of this project are based on data collected through a Google Form 
questionnaire. The survey includes questions related to quantitative data such as CGPA, CTC, and 
internships. However, the form primarily focuses on gathering qualitative information, including the 
sector of the company, role offered, technical competency details, etc. Furthermore, all branches of 
BITS have been included in the survey, providing more opportunities to identify differentiation in 
industry trends.<br>

            Our product is designed to be versatile, capable of handling any placement-related data. 
Moreover, we have built a complete end-to-end framework that can convert an academic Data 
Visualization project into a functional product. By using automation and architectural expertise, we 
achieved our goal of transforming a Data Visualization project into a fully-fledged product. 
Our architecture includes ETL, Modeling, and Visualization, with windows automation tools like 
Appium, all working together to create a complete end-to-end product or application.
